# initiative-plugin-sdk

Build a plug-in for [Initiative](https://github.com/beyonders-studio/initiative): a
service that reads and writes a community's content, answers Initiative's
calls, and draws tiles on its dashboards.

A plug-in is its logic. You write one typed definition of its endpoints, hooks,
schedules, widgets and listing; the SDK serves it, verifies Initiative's calls,
holds its tokens, and builds its manifest.

| Import | Holds |
|---|---|
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest` | `definePlugin`, `defineEndpoint`, the contract's types, `validateManifest`, `pluginApiCompatible` |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/server` | `createPlugin`, `serve`, `EndpointError` |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/client` | `Initiative` and the `Client` it gives, acting as the community or a member; plug-in keys |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/widget` | What a widget is handed, and the scenes it returns |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/parts` | The components a part's tree is built from: `Section`, `Stack`, `Field`, `Value`, `Text`, `Button` |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/jsx-runtime` | JSX for a part's tree, with no React |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/testing` | A declarative plug-in's requests, maps and writes, run against recorded vendor answers |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/plugin-api.json` | The plug-in API contract: the OpenAPI document of every route a plug-in may call |
| bin `initiative-plugin` | `init`, `build`, `pack`, `dev`, `validate`, `keygen`, `uid`, `schema` |

Node 20 or later. Two runtime dependencies, `ajv` and `jsonata`; everything
cryptographic uses `node:crypto`. `initiative-plugin build` bundles widgets with
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), which you install beside the SDK:

```sh
npm install initiative-plugin-sdk
npm install --save-dev esbuild
```

## 1. Define the plug-in

```ts
// src/plugin.ts
import { definePlugin, defineEndpoint } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest";

export const openTickets = defineEndpoint({
  direction: "read",
  label: { en: "Open tickets" },
  params: { project: { type: "string", label: { en: "Project" } } },
  returns: {
    titles: { type: "string", list: true },
    total: "int",
  },
  handler: async ({ params, installation, client }) => {
    const tickets = await lookUp(installation, params.project);
    return { result: { titles: tickets.map((ticket) => ticket.title), total: tickets.length } };
  },
});

export default definePlugin({
  publicId: "acme.tracker",
  uid: "K7M2QX8N4TVB9C", // npx initiative-plugin uid, once
  name: "Acme Tracker",
  scopes: ["projects:read", "comments:write"],
  endpoints: { "open-tickets": openTickets },
  schedules: {
    sweep: { every: "15m", run: async ({ since, installation, client }) => { /* … */ } },
  },
  widgets: {
    "open-count": {
      meta: { name: { en: "Open tickets" } },
      endpoints: ["open-tickets"],
      module: "src/widgets/open-count.ts",
      sample_data: { "open-tickets": { total: 12 } },
    },
  },
});
```

- **Types come from the definition.** An endpoint's `params` type what its
  handler is handed, and its `returns` type what the handler answers with: a
  return of the wrong type, or one the endpoint does not declare, does not
  compile. A widget or a summary naming an endpoint that is not a declared read
  does not compile either.
- **Endpoints are named by their key.** The manifest id is
  `plugin.<publicId>.<key>`, and everywhere the definition refers to an endpoint
  (a widget, a sample, a parameter's `options_from`, a bundled dashboard, an
  action) it uses the key.
- **Everything else is the contract's own shape**, from
  [`manifest.contract.json`](manifest.contract.json): `vendor`, `connections`
  (keyed by id), `webhooks`, `pages` (keyed by id),
  `dashboards`, `fields` (keyed by metadata key), `parts` and `actions` (keyed
  by id), `settings` (keyed by setting key) and `help`. The types are
  generated from the contract, so every term the contract declares has a type
  here.
- **Features follow from what is filled in.** A plug-in with widgets declares
  `widgets`, and so on.

### What a handler is handed

| | |
|---|---|
| `params` | What the caller sent, by the declared names. Initiative sends strings; an automation may send numbers and booleans as they are. |
| `installation` | The community, by the reference this plug-in knows it by. It stays the same across uninstall and reinstall, until the community erases the plug-in's data, so it is what your own rows key on. Member references hold the same way. |
| `community_status` | Where the community stands: `active`, `read_only`, `suspended`, `on_hold` or `deleted`. Anything but `active` means hold back work done on its behalf. |
| `actor` | `{ kind: "installation" }`, or `{ kind: "member", member }` when another plug-in called as one of the community's members. |
| `caller` | The plug-in that made the call through Initiative, or null for Initiative's own. |
| `initiative` | The initiative the call is confined to, or null. |
| `connections` | Connection id → the handle Initiative gives a vendor token for. |
| `viewer` | On a call one of the plug-in's actions made: the reader who ran it, by this installation's reference for them. Otherwise null. |
| `subject` | On a call one of the plug-in's actions made: the item it was run on, `{ type, id }`. Otherwise null. |
| `client` | Initiative, already acting as `actor` and narrowed to `initiative`. |
| `context` | What you gave `createPlugin` (below). |

A handler answers `{ result }`, and `actor` too when the call ran on another
credential than the call's own (a read that always uses the community's
installation, say). To refuse, throw `new EndpointError(status, code, detail)`;
anything else thrown is answered 500 and logged.

A `write` is reachable through another plug-in, as one of the actors it
declares, and only when it is `public`; or through one of the plug-in's own
actions, on an item kind the action is offered on, as the installation. The
SDK refuses anything else before the handler runs.

### Hooks

```ts
hooks: {
  after_connect: async ({ connection, actor, access_token, params, client }) => {
    const login = await vendorLogin(access_token);
    return { values: { login }, account_label: `@${login}` }; // or { refuse: true }
  },
  revoke: async ({ connection, access_token, refresh_token }) => { /* end the grant */ },
  webhook: async ({ connection, headers, body, client }) => {
    await client.emitEvent({ eventType: "plugin.acme.tracker.ticket-opened", payload: { number: 7 } });
  },
},
```

- `after_connect` runs once a connection's flow has exchanged its code, when
  the flow sets `after_connect`.
- `revoke` runs when a connection whose flow says `revoke: "hook"` ends. A
  flow can instead have Initiative end the grant itself: `rfc7009` posts to
  `revoke_url`, and `github_grant` sends GitHub's "Delete an app authorization"
  (`DELETE` with the client's credentials and the access token) to it.
- `webhook` runs once per community for each vendor delivery Initiative
  received, checked and routed; `headers` are the vendor's `x-` headers,
  lowercased, and `body` is exactly what the vendor sent.
- Each schedule's `run` is called once per community each interval, with
  `since`: when it last succeeded there, or null the first time.

A hook that throws is answered 500: a connection is then not recorded, and a
delivery or a schedule is tried again.

### The community's own hooks

Five hooks are about the community's install rather than a connection. Each
is optional; a plug-in that defines none is answered 404, and Initiative stops
sending that hook.

```ts
hooks: {
  installed: async ({ installation }) => { /* a first install, or a return */ },
  uninstalled: async ({ installation }) => { /* keep what you hold: it may come back */ },
  erase: async ({ installation }) => { /* delete everything about this community */ },
  community_status: async ({ installation, status }) => { /* pause unless active */ },
  entitlement: async ({ installation, version, values }) => { /* keep the newest */ },
},
```

- `installed` runs when the community installs the plug-in, and again if it
  returns after an uninstall. It comes back under the same `installation`
  and the same member references, so whatever you kept for it still fits.
- `uninstalled` runs when it removes the plug-in. Its references stand.
- `erase` runs when the community asks for the plug-in's data to be deleted,
  or is itself purged. Delete everything you hold for it. Once the hook
  answers, Initiative forgets the references, and a later install starts
  afresh under new ones. A hook that throws is asked again.
- `community_status` runs whenever the community's standing changes. The same
  value rides every call as `community_status`, so a missed hook is caught up
  on the next call.
- `entitlement` carries billing's statement of what this community holds of
  the plug-in: `values`, whose keys are agreed between the plug-in and
  billing, and a `version` that rises with each statement. Statements can
  repeat or arrive out of order, so keep the highest version you have seen and
  ignore a lower one. A deployment with no billing never sends one. The SDK
  verifies each statement before your hook sees it: see
  [Entitlement statements](#entitlement-statements).

### Entitlement statements

What a community holds of a plug-in (its allowance, the packs it bought) is
decided by billing, not by Initiative. So that a compromised Initiative cannot
grant itself an entitlement, billing signs each statement with a key of its
own, Initiative stores the statement and hands it on verbatim, and your
plug-in checks billing's signature. Initiative can withhold a statement; it
cannot mint or change one.

A statement is a compact JWS. Its header is
`{"alg": "EdDSA", "typ": "initiative-entitlement+jwt", "kid": …}`, and its
claims are `{"iss": "initiative-billing", "listing_uid", "community_ref",
"version", "values", "iat"}`. It has no expiry: it holds until a higher
version replaces it. The `entitlement` hook's body, and what
`client.entitlement()` reads, are both `{"statement": "<jws>"}`.

Billing's public key reaches your plug-in from the deployment, never from
Initiative: it is the runtime fact `entitlement_issuer_key`, an SPKI PEM in
`INITIATIVE_ENTITLEMENT_ISSUER_KEY_PEM`. `initiative-plugin build` adds that
fact to the runtime of every plug-in with an `entitlement` hook, so you need
not declare it, and refuses it under any other variable name.

The SDK checks every statement, on the hook and on `client.entitlement()`, in
this order, and refuses it at the first failure:

1. the key is configured and is Ed25519; without one, every statement is
   refused, and the plug-in logs why once;
2. the header's `alg` is exactly `EdDSA` and its `typ` exactly
   `initiative-entitlement+jwt`: the header never chooses the algorithm, so
   `alg: none` or an HMAC trick goes nowhere;
3. the Ed25519 signature over the JWS signing input;
4. `iss` is `initiative-billing`, `listing_uid` is your plug-in's own `uid`,
   `version` is a whole number of one or more, and `values` is an object.

Only then is your hook called, with `version` and `values` taken from the
verified claims and nothing else in the body. A refused statement is answered
`422 {"error": "statement-refused", "detail": "<reason>"}` and never reaches
your hook; `client.entitlement()` throws `EntitlementStatementError`, whose
`reason` is one of `no-key`, `bad-key`, `malformed`, `alg`, `typ`,
`signature`, `iss`, `listing` or `claims`.

**What it does not cover.** `community_ref` is billing's own pairwise
reference for the community, which your plug-in cannot relate to the
`installation` Initiative names. Initiative still vouches for which community a
statement is for, so a compromised Initiative could at worst copy a real,
signed statement from one community onto another. That gap is accepted.

**Alerts.** The SDK counts, for the process's life:

- every statement by outcome, `applied` (verified and handed on) or
  `refused-<reason>`;
- every grant of an unlimited allowance (`monthly_allowance: null`) to a
  community whose last statement the process saw did not grant one. The memory
  is the process's own, so after a restart the first such statement counts
  again.

`entitlementMetrics()` answers them as an object, and `entitlementMetricsText()`
in the Prometheus text format, to append to what your metrics endpoint serves:
`initiative_plugin_entitlement_statements_total{outcome="…"}` and
`initiative_plugin_entitlement_unlimited_grants_total`. Alert on any
`refused-*` and on any rise in unlimited grants. Neither ever refuses a
correctly signed statement.

**If you self-host.** A deployment that runs billing mints its statement
keypair and fills `INITIATIVE_ENTITLEMENT_ISSUER_KEY_PEM` for each plug-in that
declares the fact. A deployment with no billing leaves it unset: it sends no
statements, and any that did arrive would be refused.

### The vendor's own setup

`vendor.fields` are the values an operator gives once per deployment for the
vendor's client. When the vendor can create that client itself, `vendor.setup`
says how, and Initiative runs it from the operator's browser and writes what
the vendor answers into those fields. One kind exists, `github_app_manifest`
(GitHub's app manifest flow):

```ts
vendor: {
  fields: [
    { key: "app_id", type: "string", required: true, label: { en: "App id" } },
    { key: "private_key", type: "secret", required: true, label: { en: "Private key" } },
    // …
  ],
  setup: {
    kind: "github_app_manifest",
    app: {
      name: "Acme Tracker",
      url: "https://tracker.acme.example",
      default_permissions: { issues: "write", metadata: "read" },
      default_events: ["issues"],
    },
    values: { app_id: "id", private_key: "pem" /* , … */ },
  },
},
```

- `app` is what GitHub is asked to create: its name, its homepage (https),
  whether any account may install it (`public`, default false), and its
  permissions and events by GitHub's names. Initiative fills in the callback,
  setup, webhook and redirect URLs itself, so `app` names none.
- `values` maps each of your vendor field keys to one field of GitHub's answer:
  `id`, `slug`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `pem` or `webhook_secret`. Each
  key must be a vendor field, each answer is written at most once, and
  `client_secret`, `pem` and `webhook_secret` go to `secret` fields.

### A token minted on demand

A static connection's `token` has Initiative mint its access token rather than
store one: it signs a JWT with a vendor key, posts it to the vendor's
`exchange_url`, and caches the answer until shortly before it expires.
`exchange_body` is a JSON body posted with it, such as the narrower
permissions a token is asked for:

```ts
token: {
  type: "jwt_bearer",
  exchange_url: "https://api.tracker.example/installations/{installation_id}/tokens",
  exchange_body: { permissions: { issues: "write", contents: "read" } },
  iss: "{vendor.app_id}",
  key: "{vendor.private_key}",
},
```

`exchange_url`, `iss` and every string in `exchange_body` may name a vendor
value as `{vendor.<key>}` and one of the connection's own fields as `{<key>}`;
`validateManifest` refuses a name that neither declares.

### Pages

A page is one of your plug-in's screens, framed by Initiative:

```ts
pages: {
  board: {
    path: "/board",
    name: { en: "Board" },
    scopes: ["initiative"],
    handler: async ({ request, handoff }) => {
      if (!handoff) return servePage(request); // the page's own files
      return startSession(handoff.viewer, handoff.initiative);
    },
  },
},
```

Initiative hands the frame a one-use handoff token. Send it from the page to
any path under the page's as `Authorization: Bearer …`: the SDK verifies it
(type, signature, audience, page, and that it was not used before) and hands the
handler `viewer`, `admin`, `initiative` and a `client` acting as the
installation, narrowed to that initiative.

### Where a community stands

`communitySummary` names a read whose returns say what a community has used and
is allowed. A deployment may draw them on the community's settings page, each
under its own `label`. A return with `of` is counted against another, so the two
are drawn as one measure:

```ts
returns: {
  runs_used: { type: "int", label: { en: "Runs this month" }, of: "allowance" },
  allowance: { type: "int", label: { en: "Monthly allowance" } }, // null: no ceiling
  pack_credits: { type: "int", label: { en: "Credits left" } },
  resets_on: { type: "datetime", label: { en: "Resets" } },
},
```

### Minimum age

`minimumAge` says how old somebody must be to use the plug-in, by ISO 3166-1
alpha-2 country, with `default` for every country not listed:
`{ default: 16, US: 13 }`. It is a declaration; whether a deployment enforces
it is the deployment's decision.

### Fields, parts and actions

What a plug-in adds to the views and pages of Initiative's items: tasks,
calendar events, queue items, counters, gallery images and posts
(`ITEM_KINDS`). Initiative draws all of it with its own components, so no
plug-in code runs in a reader's browser, and the community's managers place
it; a plug-in never places itself. Any plug-in may declare them, container or
declarative.

**Metadata** is what the plug-in keeps on an item or on its own install: values
by key (a lowercase letter, then lowercase letters, digits, `_` and `.`), held
by Initiative. A container writes them with its installation token
(`client.metadata`, below); for a declarative plug-in, Initiative writes them
from the plug-in's expressions ([Declarative integrations](#declarative-integrations)).
Initiative enforces its sizes: a value of at most 8192 bytes as JSON,
32 keys and 64 KiB on one item, and 256 keys and 1 MiB on the install. A
string of at most 255 characters can be found by.

**A field** says how one metadata key is shown. Initiative draws the value with
its own component for `kind` and computes its plain text itself, so a field
filters, sorts and exports with no call to the plug-in.

| `kind` | The value |
|---|---|
| `text` | a string |
| `number` | a number |
| `date` | `"YYYY-MM-DD"` |
| `datetime` | ISO 8601, with its offset |
| `link` | `{ url, text? }` |
| `badge` | `{ text, tone? }` |
| `progress` | `{ value, max }` |
| `checkbox` | a boolean |

```ts
fields: {
  "demo.link": { name: { en: "Demo" }, kind: "link", on: ["task"], description: { en: "The task's demo" } },
  "demo.opened": { name: { en: "Opened" }, kind: "number", on: ["task"] },
},
```

`on` is the item kinds it is offered on; `description` is the line the view
editor's Add picker shows; `tone` is a badge's tone when its value names none
(`accent`, `positive`, `negative`, `warning`, `neutral`, `muted`).

**A list field**, `list: true`, holds several values: its value is a list of
elements, each one value of the field's `kind` with a `ref` of 1 to 255
characters that tells it from the others. A `text`, `number`, `date`,
`datetime` or `checkbox` element is `{ ref, value }`; a `link`, `badge` or
`progress` element is the kind's own object with its `ref`, such as
`{ ref, url, text? }`. Initiative keeps each element as a value of its own,
held to the size of one value, and finds an element by its `ref`.

**States** say what state a value is in, in the plug-in's own words: up to 4
facets, each with up to 12 keys. A value names a key of each facet it is in as
`state`, and Initiative draws one badge per facet, labelled in the reader's
language. A list element, and a `link`, `badge` or `progress` value, carries
`state` beside its other properties; a `text`, `number`, `date`, `datetime` or
`checkbox` value that carries one is written as an element is, without the
`ref`: `{ value, state }`.

```ts
fields: {
  "tracker.issues": {
    name: { en: "Issues" },
    kind: "link",
    list: true,
    on: ["task"],
    states: {
      status: {
        name: { en: "Status" },
        values: { open: { label: { en: "Open" }, tone: "positive" }, closed: { label: { en: "Closed" }, tone: "muted" } },
      },
    },
    actions: ["unlink"],
  },
},
// an element: { ref: "12", url: "https://tracker.example/issues/12", text: "#12", state: { status: "open" } }
```

A list field's `actions` are offered on each of its elements, and each is
offered on every item kind the field is. They are a declarative plug-in's: an
action run from an element reads the element's `ref` as `element`, and a
container's handler is told the item alone.

**An action** runs on one item, from a part's button, from the item's own menu
with `menu: true`, or from an element of a list field that offers it. A
container plug-in's action names one of its write endpoints: Initiative calls
it as the installation, with `viewer` and `subject` set, and the handler does
the work, usually writing metadata. A declarative plug-in's names an endpoint,
a `write`, or both, and Initiative does the work itself. Either way Initiative
then answers the reader with the item's metadata as it stands. With `confirm`,
Initiative asks first; with `admin_only: true`, only the community's admins may
run it.

`params` names the endpoint's params Initiative asks the reader for before it
runs the action, in a form drawn from their own declarations: each one's type,
label, and `options` or `options_from`. The endpoint is sent the reader's
answers and nothing else, so every param it requires is among them.

```ts
actions: {
  "new-link": { name: { en: "New link" }, endpoint: "create-link", params: ["url"], on: ["task"], menu: true },
},
```

**A part** is a tree of Initiative's components bound to the plug-in's fields
and actions, at most 50 nodes and 4 deep. Initiative places at most 3 of a
plug-in's parts on one item.

| Component | Props | Holds nodes |
|---|---|---|
| `section` | `title?`, `collapsed?` | yes |
| `stack` | `direction?` (`row`, `column`), `gap?` (`none`, `small`, `medium`, `large`), `wrap?` | yes |
| `field` | `field`: a field's key. Its label and value. | no |
| `value` | `field`: a field's key. Its value alone. | no |
| `text` | `text`, `tone?` | no |
| `button` | `action`: an action's id; `variant?` (`primary`, `secondary`, `ghost`) | no |

Every field and action a part names must be offered on each kind in the
part's `on`. A `text` node's text may name `{item.id}`, the item's id, and
`{settings.<key>}`, one of the plug-in's [settings](#settings-and-help), which
Initiative fills in when it draws the part; `validateManifest` refuses any
other `{…}`. A tree is plain data, `{ type, props?, children? }`, or JSX
through the SDK's runtime, which the build turns into the same data:

```tsx
/** @jsxImportSource initiative-plugin-sdk */
import { Button, Field, Section, Stack, Text, Value } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/parts";

parts: {
  demo: {
    name: { en: "Demo" },
    on: ["task"],
    tree: (
      <Section title={{ en: "Demo" }}>
        <Field field="demo.link" />
        <Stack direction="row" gap="small">
          <Value field="demo.opened" />
          <Text text={{ en: "times opened" }} tone="muted" />
        </Stack>
        <Button action="new-link" />
      </Section>
    ),
  },
},
```

The pragma, or `"jsx": "react-jsx"` and `"jsxImportSource":
"initiative-plugin-sdk"` in `tsconfig.json`, selects the runtime. A fragment's
children join the node that holds it, and `null` and `false` children are left
out. `key` is JSX's own and is not passed on, which is why a field is named by
`field`.

### Settings and help

**Settings** are values the community's admins see and may change on the
install, keyed by setting key, at most 16. A part's text names one as
`{settings.<key>}`, and a declarative plug-in's expressions read them as
`settings.<key>`.

```ts
settings: {
  prefix: { type: "string", label: { en: "Reference prefix" }, unique: true, assigned: "community_name" },
},
```

A `unique` setting's value is held by no other community on the deployment for
this plug-in, and is a lowercase letter, then lowercase letters and digits, 2
to 16 characters in all (`^[a-z][a-z0-9]{1,15}$`), so a reference such as
`acme-7` reads one way. With `assigned: "community_name"`, Initiative gives it a
value when the community installs the plug-in: the letters and digits of the
community's name, in lowercase, with a short random suffix when another
community holds that value. An admin may rename it. The earlier values stay the
community's, and expressions read them as `aliases.<key>`, so a reference made
under one still resolves.

**Help** is markdown, by language tag, at most 2000 characters in each.
Initiative shows it behind a "?" on the headers of the plug-in's parts and on
its settings:

```ts
help: { en: "Links issues to tasks. Name a task's reference, such as **acme-7**, in an issue's title to link it." },
```

## 2. Widgets

A widget is a module exporting `render`, typed from the endpoint it draws:

```ts
// src/widgets/open-count.ts
import type { Scene, WidgetData } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/widget";
import type { openTickets } from "../plugin.js";

export function render(data: WidgetData<typeof openTickets>): Scene {
  return { v: 1, scene: { kind: "metric", value: data.values.total ?? 0, label: "Open" } };
}
```

`data.rows` holds one entry per index across the endpoint's `list` returns,
and `data.values` its single-valued returns. `render` also receives the tile's
options and `{ locale, slots }`.

The build bundles each widget, with everything it imports, into the one script
Initiative runs in a sandbox with no network, DOM or timers, and checks the
contract's size cap. A widget imports nothing at run time.

## 3. Build

```sh
npx initiative-plugin build              # writes manifest.json
npx initiative-plugin build --check      # CI: fails if manifest.json is stale
```

`build` reads `src/plugin.ts` (`--plugin <file>` for another), bundles the widgets,
checks the result with `validateManifest`, and writes `manifest.json`. Commit
it and ship it with the plug-in: the server serves it, and refuses to start if it
no longer matches the definition.

## 4. Serve

```ts
// src/main.ts
import plugin from "./plugin.js";
import { createPlugin, serve } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/server";

serve(createPlugin(plugin));
```

`createPlugin(plugin, options)` returns a web-standard `(Request) => Promise<Response>`
handler, so the same plug-in runs on any runtime, or behind any framework, that
speaks `Request` and `Response`. `serve` runs it on `node:http`, on `PORT`
(default 8080).

| `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` | The plug-in's public key. |
| `GET /.well-known/initiative-plugin.json` | The manifest document: the manifest with the plug-in's id, uid and name. |
| `GET, POST /v1/endpoints` | What the plug-in declares; Initiative's endpoint calls, on a context token. |
| `POST /v1/hooks/{name}` | Initiative's hook calls, on a lifecycle token for that hook. |
| a page's path | The page's handler. |

Every call's token is an EdDSA JWT, verified against the deployment's JWKS,
which is cached and refetched once for a key it does not know. Only the set's
Ed25519 keys are read, and a token signed any other way (RS256, ES256, `none`) is
refused. Each kind carries its own `typ`
(`initiative-context+jwt` on endpoint and hook calls, `initiative-handoff+jwt` on
a page handoff), and each path takes only its own kind. Bodies are capped at 5 MiB. A
refusal answers `{ "error": code, "detail": sentence }`.

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | `INITIATIVE_BASE_URL` | Initiative's API as the plug-in reaches it, such as `http://initiative:8173/api/v1`. |
| `key` | `INITIATIVE_PLUGIN_PRIVATE_KEY`, `INITIATIVE_PLUGIN_KEY_ID` | The plug-in's key: PEM, PEM with literal `\n`, or base64 of the PEM, and the `kid` it is registered under (default: its RFC 7638 thumbprint). |
| `dataDir` | `INITIATIVE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR`, else `data` | With no key given, one is generated on first start and kept here as `plugin-key.pem`. |
| `manifest` | `manifest.json` | The built manifest. |
| `context` | | Handed to every handler as `context`. |
| `fetch`, `now`, `log`, `env` | | For tests and other runtimes. |

**The plug-in's key.** With no key given, the plug-in generates an Ed25519 key the first
time it starts, keeps it, and serves its public half at
`/.well-known/jwks.json`. The deployment running it registers that JWKS with
Initiative, beside where the plug-in runs, in its `PLUGIN_SERVICES_CONFIG` entry or
under **Settings → Platform → Integrations → Plug-in services**. At every start
the plug-in logs each key it serves:

```text
plug-in key fingerprint: <thumbprint> (kid <kid>)
```

The fingerprint is the key's RFC 7638 SHA-256 thumbprint, base64url without
padding, the value Initiative shows when the operator connects the plug-in, so the
two can be compared. `jwkThumbprint` from `initiative-plugin-sdk/client` computes
it for a JWKS entry. To bring your own key:

```sh
npx initiative-plugin keygen --out ./secrets
```

`private-key.pem` (mode 0600) stays with the plug-in; `jwks.json` is its public
half. To rotate, publish a JWKS holding both keys, switch the plug-in to the new
one, then drop the old entry.

Every plug-in key is Ed25519, signing EdDSA, as is the deployment's own key. Its signatures are deterministic,
so there is no per-signature nonce whose reuse or bias would give the key away.
`loadPrivateKey` refuses any other kind of key. A deployment that runs the
plug-in from its package mints the key for it.

**Context.** Your own services reach handlers as `context`. Say what it holds
once:

```ts
declare module "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest" {
  interface PluginContext {
    tracker: TrackerClient;
  }
}

serve(createPlugin(plugin, { context: { tracker: new TrackerClient() } }));
```

## 5. Call Initiative

A handler's `client` already acts for its call. Outside a call, make one:

```ts
import { Initiative, loadPrivateKey } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/client";

const initiative = new Initiative({
  baseUrl: "https://initiative.example.com/api/v1",
  publicId: "acme.tracker",
  key: loadPrivateKey(pem, "plugin-1"),
});

for (const { installation, active } of await initiative.installations()) {
  if (!active) continue; // paused: keep what you hold for it
  const client = initiative.asInstallation(installation);
  const { items } = await client.api.listProjects({ query: { initiative_id: 12 } });
}
```

An `Initiative` made by hand reads `client.entitlement()` only when it is given
something to check statements with: `entitlements: new EntitlementStatements({
listingUid: plugin.uid })`, which reads billing's key from
`INITIATIVE_ENTITLEMENT_ISSUER_KEY_PEM`. The server's own client has one.

- `asInstallation(installation, { initiative, scopes })` acts as the community,
  optionally narrowed to one initiative the plug-in is placed in and fewer scopes.
- `asMember(installation, member, { purpose, initiative })` acts for one
  member, within what they consented to (`client.requestConsent(…)`);
  `ConsentRequiredError` says they have not.
- `client.api` has a typed method for every route Initiative's plug-in API
  describes, named after the route's operation id in camel case. A call takes
  its arguments by where they go, and answers the route's typed response:

  ```ts
  const task = await client.api.updateTask({ path: { task_id: 7 }, body: { title: "Ship it" } });
  await client.api.archiveEntity({ path: { entity_type: "file", entity_id: 3 } });
  ```

  No call is sent unless the token holds the scope it needs: the route's own,
  the one its argument picks (`archiveEntity` on a `file` needs
  `files:write`), or, where Initiative checks each item, at least one of
  them. `MissingScopeError` names the scope instead. Writing implies reading.

  `client.api` is generated from the plug-in API contract this SDK publishes
  ([The plug-in API contract](#the-plug-in-api-contract)), so it changes as
  the contract does: a minor release adds routes and fields, and only a major
  release removes or changes one.
  `PluginApiSchemas["TaskRead"]` names a schema's type.
- `client.request(method, path, { scope, body })` calls a community route (the
  path after `/c/{community}`) by hand, with the same scope check.
- `client.callPlugin(publicId, endpointId, params)` calls another plug-in's public
  endpoint through Initiative. It needs `plugins:<publicId>` among the plug-in's
  scopes, granted by the community. A plug-in that uses whichever plug-ins a
  community lets it sets `callsPlugins: true` (the manifest's
  `service.calls_plugins`) instead of naming each: a community that installs
  another plug-in is asked there whether this one may use it, which grants the
  scope.
- `client.metadata`, the plug-in's metadata, always on the installation's
  token: `get(itemKind, ids)` answers each item's values by id;
  `set(itemKind, id, values)` writes some of one item's values, a null
  removing its key, and answers them as they now stand; `find(key, value)`
  answers the items holding `value` under `key`, as `{ type, id }`.
  `metadata.install.get()` and `metadata.install.set(values)` do the same for
  the install's own values.
- The installation itself, on any installation token: `client.config()`,
  `client.connections()`, `client.connectionToken(ref)` for a usable vendor
  token, `client.reportConfigStatus({ state, detail })`, and
  `client.emitEvent({ eventType, payload, initiativeId })`.
- What the community holds of the plug-in: `client.entitlement()` reads the
  statement the `entitlement` hook delivers, verified the same way, or null
  when there is none, and
  `client.reportUsage({ meter, period, quantity })` reports a meter's total
  for one `YYYY-MM` period. The total is the whole period's, never an
  increment, so repeating a report is harmless. Only meters the deployment
  allows the plug-in are accepted.

The plug-in authenticates with its key (`private_key_jwt`, RFC 7523). Tokens are
opaque; the client caches each until shortly before it expires, shares one
request between concurrent callers, and sends a call answered 401 once more on
a fresh token. A refusal raises `InitiativeApiError` with Initiative's
`detail`; the token endpoint's own refusal raises `InitiativeAuthError`.

## 6. Publish

Initiative installs plug-ins from signed registries. A listing names the plug-in, its
versions, the container image each runs (pinned by digest) and the most it may
ever be granted. It names no keys: each deployment runs its own copy of the
image and registers the key that copy signs with. Declare it in the definition:

```ts
listing: {
  publisher: "acme",
  summary: "Your tracker's tickets on a dashboard and in your automations.",
  description: "…",
  avatar: "assets/avatar.png",
  images: [{ path: "assets/board.png", alt: "Open tickets on a dashboard" }],
  version: "1.2.0",
  minAppVersion: "0.72.0",
  releaseNotes: "…",
  image: "ghcr.io/acme/tracker@sha256:…",
  compose: {
    service: `tracker:
  image: \${IMAGE}
  environment:
    INITIATIVE_URL: \${INITIATIVE_URL}
  volumes: [tracker-keys:/data]`,
    baseUrl: "http://tracker:8080",
  },
},
```

`images` is optional: the screenshots on the listing page, in order, at most
12. Each is a PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, AVIF or SVG file with `alt` text of 1 to
300 characters for someone who cannot see it, and a file name of its own (the
avatar sits beside them in the registry source). The registry signs each one
by its digest, as it does the avatar. `pack` leaves them out: a deployment's
own listing upload takes only the avatar.

`compose` is optional: the Docker Compose service an operator copies to run
your image beside Initiative, which Initiative shows on the plug-in's settings
page. `service` is the fragment, YAML text of at most 4096 characters, with two
placeholders Initiative fills: `${IMAGE}` (`image`, pinned by its digest) and
`${INITIATIVE_URL}` (the deployment's public address). Any other `${…}` fails
the build, so a misspelt placeholder cannot ship. `baseUrl` is where the
service answers on the Compose network, an http or https URL of at most 512
characters; Initiative pre-fills the deployment's base URL with it.

`runtime` is optional too, and is for a plug-in a deployment runs for its
operator from a reviewed package. It says what the container needs, so the
deployment can run it with no code of its own:

```ts
runtime: {
  name: "tracker",
  port: 8080,
  health: { ready: "/readyz", live: "/healthz" },
  facts: { INITIATIVE_API_URL: "app_api_internal" },
  settings: [{ env: "TRACKER_MODE", required: true }],
  signingKey: { env: "TRACKER_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM" },
  database: {
    roles: [{ id: "owner", login: "tracker_owner", env: "DATABASE_URL" }],
    provisionSql: "/app/provision.sql",
  },
},
```

It holds nothing that raises a privilege. Resources, network rules, hostnames
and every key and password stay the deployment's:

- `facts` come from a fixed list: `app_url`, `app_origin`, `app_api_public`,
  `app_api_internal`, `page_origin`, `port` and `entitlement_issuer_key`
  (billing's statement key, added for you with an `entitlement` hook; see
  [Entitlement statements](#entitlement-statements)). There is no other
  channel to Initiative's own services: billing reaches a plug-in only through
  Initiative.
- `settings` are names the operator fills.
- `secrets` are generated by the deployment and kept.

The public registry refuses a listing that carries a runtime.

`minAppVersion` is the oldest Initiative release a version runs on. Beside it,
the definition's `minPluginApi` (the manifest's `min_plugin_api`) is the
oldest [plug-in API contract](#the-plug-in-api-contract) the plug-in calls, as
`"MAJOR.MINOR"`: the SDK version its `client.api` was written against.

```ts
definePlugin({ publicId: "acme.tracker", /* … */ minPluginApi: "4.1" });
```

A deployment serving contract `4.3.2` runs it; one serving `4.0.5` or `5.0.0`
does not. Leave it out and the plug-in makes no claim: it is offered on any
contract, as listings written before the field were.

```sh
npx initiative-plugin build --registry ../registry/sources
```

writes the plug-in's registry source under `<publisher>/<uid>/`: `listing.json`,
this version's `<version>/manifest.json` and the avatar. It is written only
while `listing.version` is the package's own version: between releases the
package runs ahead of its listing, and a new version is listed at its release,
with its image's digest. The registry's CI checks and signs what is merged.

A plug-in written in another language builds its manifest itself and hands the
SDK a JSON file in place of `src/plugin.ts`: its `publicId`, `uid` and `name`,
its `manifest`, and its `listing` as declared above. The manifest is checked as
a definition's is, and the listing states the version it lists:

```sh
npx initiative-plugin build --manifest plugin.json --registry ../registry/sources
npx initiative-plugin pack --manifest plugin.json
```

A self-hosted deployment can also publish a plug-in that is in no registry, from
its listing file: see [A private plug-in](#a-private-plug-in).

## Declarative integrations

A plug-in that only calls a vendor's API and reshapes the answer needs no
container. Name the `hosts` it calls and give each endpoint a `request` and a
`map` in place of a handler: Initiative makes the call with the connection's
credential, and maps the answer itself. The plug-in has no `service` block, no
image and nothing to run, and its listing registers it as `declarative`. It
may still keep values on Initiative's items, which its webhook events,
schedules and actions write and its fields and parts show.

```ts
// src/plugin.ts
import { definePlugin, defineEndpoint } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest";

export const openIssues = defineEndpoint({
  direction: "read",
  label: { en: "Open issues" },
  params: { repo: { type: "string", label: { en: "Repository" }, required: true } },
  requires: { all_of: ["account"] },
  returns: { titles: { type: "string", list: true }, total: "int" },
  request: {
    method: "GET",
    url: '"https://api.tracker.example/repos/" & params.repo & "/issues"',
    query: { state: '"open"' },
    connection: "account",
  },
  map: '{"titles": response.body.title[], "total": $count(response.body)}',
});

export default definePlugin({
  publicId: "acme.tracker",
  uid: "K7M2QX8N4TVB9C",
  name: "Acme Tracker",
  hosts: ["api.tracker.example"],
  connections: {
    account: {
      scope: "interactive",
      label: { en: "Your account" },
      fields: [],
      flow: {
        type: "oauth2",
        authorize_url: "https://tracker.example/oauth/authorize",
        token_url: "https://tracker.example/oauth/token",
        client_id: "{vendor.client_id}",
      },
    },
  },
  vendor: { fields: [{ key: "client_id", type: "string", required: true, label: { en: "Client id" } }] },
  endpoints: { "open-issues": openIssues },
  listing: { publisher: "acme", summary: "Your tracker's issues.", avatar: "assets/avatar.png", version: "1.0.0" },
});
```

```ts
// test/open-issues.test.ts
import { expect, it } from "vitest";
import { runEndpoint } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/testing";
import plugin from "../src/plugin.js";
import issues from "./fixtures/issues.json" with { type: "json" };

it("lists a repository's open issues", async () => {
  const run = await runEndpoint(plugin, "open-issues", {
    params: { repo: "acme/web" },
    now: "2026-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    responses: [{ status: 200, body: issues }],
  });
  expect(run.requests).toEqual([
    {
      method: "GET",
      url: "https://api.tracker.example/repos/acme/web/issues?state=open",
      headers: {},
      connection: "account",
    },
  ]);
  expect(run).toMatchObject({ result: { titles: ["Broken build"], total: 1 } });
});
```

- **Every expression is [JSONata](https://jsonata.org)**, standard, with no
  functions added: the URL, each query parameter and header, the body or a
  GraphQL request's `variables`, and the map. An expression reads `params`,
  `connection` (the non-secret fields of the connection its request names),
  `connections` (on an endpoint, each connection its `requires` names that the
  call has, by id: `connections.workspace.owner`), `now`, and once a call has
  been answered `response` (`status`, `headers`, `body`). Every expression
  also reads `settings`, the install's [settings](#settings-and-help) by key,
  and `aliases`, each unique setting's earlier values. `build` parses every
  one and fails with its place in the manifest when one does not parse.
- **Each evaluation is bounded** by the contract's `CAPS.expressionTimeMs`,
  `CAPS.expressionDepth` and `CAPS.expressionOutputBytes`; past one, or on an
  error, the call answers `unavailable: mapping-failed`. `evaluate` from
  `initiative-plugin-sdk/testing` runs an expression within the same bounds.
- **Credentials never enter an expression.** Initiative adds the one the
  request's `connection` names, as `auth` says: `Authorization: Bearer
  <token>` unless `auth: { header, prefix }` says otherwise. Every address
  must be https on one of `hosts`, exact or with one leading `*.` label. A
  request or step naming an `interactive` connection for every call names it
  in the endpoint's `requires` too, and is on no endpoint whose `actors`
  include `installation`, or `build` fails: a call made as the installation
  has no member's credential. A call made as a member carries a `static`
  connection's credential only when `requires` names it, and is refused
  otherwise.
- **A connection per actor.** A write's request or step may name one
  connection for each of the endpoint's `actors` in place of one for every
  call, so a call made as the member carries the member's own credential and
  one made as the installation the community's:

  ```ts
  export const comment = defineEndpoint({
    direction: "write",
    actors: ["member", "installation"],
    params: {
      number: { type: "int", label: { en: "Issue" }, required: true },
      text: { type: "string", label: { en: "Comment" }, required: true },
    },
    returns: { id: "int" },
    request: {
      method: "POST",
      url: '"https://api.tracker.example/issues/" & params.number & "/comments"',
      body: '{"body": params.text}',
      connection: { member: "account", installation: "workspace" },
    },
    map: '{"id": response.body.id}',
  });
  ```

  `member` names an `interactive` connection and `installation` a `static`
  one, for exactly the actors the endpoint declares. The member's needs no
  `requires`: a call made as the member requires it. An expression's
  `connection` holds the fields of the one the call carries.
- **`steps`** in place of `request` makes up to three calls in order; each
  reads the earlier ones as `steps.<name>`, and so does the map.
- **`paging`** on a request reads more pages before the map runs:
  `page_number`, `link_header` or `cursor`, each with `max_pages` (at most 10)
  and `on_limit`, `truncate` or `refuse`.
- **Errors.** 401 and 403 answer `unavailable: not-authorized`, 404
  `not-found`, other 4xx `invalid`, and 429, 3xx and 5xx are transient.
  `errors` rows match a status (`404` or `"4xx"`) and an optional `when`, such
  as a GraphQL error inside a 200, to a code the endpoint declares in
  `unavailable`, or to `transient`. A map may answer
  `{"unavailable": "<code>"}` itself.
- **Connections** take a declarative `after_connect` (a request or up to
  three `steps`, a map to `{values, account_label}`, and `refuse_when` with
  its `code`, which read each step as `steps.<name>`) and a
  `health` check run on an interval. **Webhooks** take `events`, each mapping
  a delivery to one of the plug-in's emissions, changes to its values, or
  both, and `status` rows that set a connection's state; a delivery may be
  routed by a `header` instead of a body `path`.
- **Scopes** are read scopes alone, at the manifest's top level, and
  `validateManifest` refuses any other: a declarative plug-in keeps its own
  values on items it can read, and does not call Initiative. Initiative keeps
  its values only on items those scopes read, such as tasks with
  `projects:read`.
- **Values** are written from a `write` expression: Initiative makes the
  changes it answers, as the install. A **change** sets values by key,
  `{"set": {"<key>": <value>}}`, the shape of `client.metadata.set`: a null
  removes its key, and every value is held to the metadata caps. A list
  field's value is its whole list of elements; its elements change by their
  `ref` with `{"upsert": {"<key>": [<element>]}}`, which adds each element or
  merges it into the one with its `ref` (the properties it gives replace that
  element's, the rest stay, and its `state` merges by facet, so a write that
  knows one fact changes that fact alone), and `{"remove": {"<key>": ["<ref>"]}}`. A
  change gives at least one of `set`, `upsert` and `remove`, and changes each
  key with only one. A **targeted change** adds its `target`:
  `{"kind": "task", "id": 7}` for one item, `{"install": true}` for the
  install, or `{"holding": {"key": "<key>", "value": "<text>"}}` for every item
  on which the install holds that value under that key (a number or a boolean
  as JSON writes it, a list element by its `ref`). A target the install cannot
  read is skipped, one `write` answers at most 100 targeted changes
  (`CAPS.writeTargets`), and a `write` answering nothing changes nothing.
  - An **event** row's `write`, beside its `emit` and `map` or in their place,
    answers targeted changes from `headers`, `payload`, `connection`, `now`,
    `settings` and `aliases`. The first row whose `when` holds applies, its
    emission and its write both.
  - An **action** names an `endpoint`, a `write`, or both. The endpoint may be
    a read, fetching what the `write` keeps, or a write that changes something
    at the vendor. Initiative makes the endpoint's call with the `params` the
    reader answered, on the credential its `actors` say, its expressions also
    reading `item` (`{kind, id, title}`) and `element` (the `ref` of the list
    element it was run from, if any), then the one change `write` answers from
    `item`, `held` (the install's values on the item), `result` (the
    endpoint's mapped answer), `params`, `element`, `settings`, `aliases` and
    `now`.
  - A **schedule** makes a read as the installation on an interval: `endpoint`
    names a read endpoint whose `actors` include `installation`, `params`
    answers its params from `since` (when the schedule last succeeded, or
    null), `now`, `connection`, `settings` and `aliases`, and `write` answers
    targeted changes from `result`, `since`, `now`, `settings` and `aliases`.
    Its id is none of the plug-in's connections': Initiative keys connection
    health checks by connection id.

  ```ts
  schedules: {
    sync: {
      every: "1h",
      endpoint: "updated-issues", // returns numbers: int list, states: string list
      params: '{"since": since}',
      write:
        '[$map(result.numbers, function($n, $i) { {"target": {"holding": {"key": "issue.number", "value": $string($n)}}, "set": {"issue.state": result.states[$i]}} })]',
    },
  },
  actions: {
    create: {
      name: { en: "Create an issue" },
      endpoint: "create-issue", // returns number: int, url: string
      on: ["task"],
      write: '{"set": {"issue.number": result.number, "issue.link": {"url": result.url, "text": "#" & result.number}}}',
    },
    link: {
      name: { en: "Link an issue" },
      endpoint: "link-issue", // takes number: int; returns number: int, url: string, state: string
      params: ["number"],
      on: ["task"],
      write: '{"upsert": {"issues.linked": [{"ref": $string(result.number), "url": result.url, "state": {"status": result.state}}]}}',
    },
    unlink: { name: { en: "Unlink" }, on: ["task"], write: '{"remove": {"issues.linked": [element]}}' }, // a list field's element action
  },
  ```

  Wrap a list a `write` answers in `[ ]`: a JSONata path matching one item
  answers it alone, and a run refuses a lone change where a list belongs.
- **One plug-in is one kind.** A declarative plug-in is a manifest Initiative
  runs, with no plug-in code: it has no handlers, hooks or pages. A container
  plug-in ships code, which Initiative calls, and uses none of the declarative
  terms. Any plug-in may keep values on items in Initiative: a container
  writes them with its installation token, and for a declarative plug-in
  Initiative writes them from the plug-in's expressions. `validateManifest`
  and `build` refuse a mix.

`runEndpoint`, `runAfterConnect`, `runHealth`, `runAction` and `runSchedule`
render each request as Initiative sends it, less the credential, answer it from
the recorded `responses` in order, and return the requests beside the result or
the code the run answered. `runEndpoint` takes each connection's fields by id
in `connections`, and the `actor` the call is made as, by default the
endpoint's first: a request naming a connection per actor carries that
actor's. It does not refuse a call the way Initiative would for who is making
it. `runAction` takes the `item`, what the install `held` on it, the `params`
the reader answered, the `element` it was run from and its endpoint's `actor`,
and answers the endpoint's `result` and the `change`; `runSchedule` takes
`since`, makes its read as the installation, and answers the endpoint's
`result` and the `writes`;
`runWebhook` answers a delivery's `event`, `writes` and `status`. Every runner
takes the install's `settings` and `aliases`. A run fails when a request has no
recorded answer left, when an answer is left over, when the map's answer does
not fit the declared returns, or when a `write` answers what is not a change:
one that changes a key twice, gives a list field anything but a list of
elements, or upserts or removes elements of a field that is not a list.

## A private plug-in

A deployment's owner can publish a plug-in of their own, which then sits on that
deployment's shelf beside the registry's. Start one from the example, a
declarative plug-in with one read and one widget:

```sh
npx initiative-plugin-sdk init my-plugin      # copies examples/minimal, with a uid of its own
cd my-plugin && npm install && npm test
```

```sh
npx initiative-plugin pack                 # writes <publicId>-<version>.json
```

`pack` builds the plug-in as `build` does, checks it the same way, and writes its
**listing file**: what the catalogue shows, this version's manifest, and the
plug-in's registration. The deployment publishes it as it is, from
`POST /api/v1/marketplace/local/upload` (the file as `{"manifest": …}`) or from
its catalog directory (`MARKETPLACE_EXTRA_CATALOG_DIR`). The listing's picture
is named by its digest, so upload it beside the file, to
`POST /api/v1/marketplace/local/media`; PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP are kept, and
any other picture leaves the deployment's default mark. Both routes take the
owner's session or personal API key. A container plug-in packs too, and is live
once its service is registered on the deployment.

```sh
npx initiative-plugin dev --initiative https://initiative.example.com --api-key ppk_…
```

`dev` packs a declarative plug-in and uploads it, with its picture, to your
deployment, then again a moment after each change in the directory holding
`src/plugin.ts`. The key may be given as `INITIATIVE_API_KEY` instead. It prints
each upload and the deployment's answer:

```text
uploaded example.gitlab-issues 1.0.0-dev.3f9a2c1b (uid ZNV2THEZGPHXXG): 201 {"uid":"ZNV2THEZGPHXXG","public_id":"example.gitlab-issues","version":"1.0.0-dev.3f9a2c1b"}
watching src for changes
```

A deployment publishes each version once, so each upload is versioned
`<listing version>-dev.<digest>`. A community that installed the plug-in moves to
it from its Update button, or on its own if it follows updates. The plug-in is
offered once the vendor values its manifest requires are set under the
deployment's plug-in services.

## Validating by hand

```sh
npx initiative-plugin validate manifest.json   # a manifest, or a served manifest document
npx initiative-plugin schema                   # the JSON Schema it checks against
```

`validateManifest` runs the bundled JSON Schema, then the checks a schema
cannot express: features against the blocks present, ids that must name
something the manifest declares, connection, vendor setup and schedule rules,
what a part's nodes, a list field's element actions and an action's `params`
name, the placeholders in a part's text, a part's size and depth, and every
term the contract does not declare (a deployment discards those without saying
so). The deployment also enforces byte-size caps.

## The contract

`manifest.contract.json` is the one hand-written statement of what a manifest
may say. `schemas/plugin-manifest.json` and `src/contract.ts` (its types) are
generated from it with `npm run generate`; `npm run check:generated` fails when
either is stale. Initiative vendors the contract from this repository's tags.

## The plug-in API contract

A plug-in and Initiative release on their own schedules. What they share is
one file this package publishes, `schemas/plugin-api.json`, exported as
`initiative-plugin-sdk/plugin-api.json`: the OpenAPI document of every route a
plug-in may call, as Initiative describes it. A plug-in depends on an SDK
version and nothing else.

- **The contract version is this package's version.** The file's
  `info.version` is the SDK's version, and `info["x-initiative-source"]` names
  the Initiative release and commit the document was taken from. A minor
  release adds operations, fields or optional parameters; removing or changing
  anything is a major release.
- **Every client comes from the file.** `src/plugin-api.generated.ts`, behind
  `client.api`, is generated from `schemas/plugin-api.json`, never from
  Initiative directly. A plug-in in another language generates its own client
  from the same file, at the SDK version it targets.
- **A deployment serves the contract it vendors.** Initiative carries a copy of
  this file from an SDK release, serves that SDK version as its plug-in API
  version, and checks in its own CI that what it serves still holds every
  route, parameter and response field the copy has. It may serve more.
- **A plug-in names the oldest contract it needs**, as `min_plugin_api`
  (`"MAJOR.MINOR"`) in its manifest. A deployment serving contract `S` runs a
  plug-in needing `N` when they share a major version and `S`'s minor is at
  least `N`'s. A manifest without the field runs on any contract.
  Initiative, the registry and the SDK decide with the same rule, exported as
  `pluginApiCompatible`:

  ```ts
  import { pluginApiCompatible } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest";

  pluginApiCompatible("4.3.2", "4.1"); // true
  pluginApiCompatible("5.0.0", "4.1"); // false: another major
  pluginApiCompatible("4.3.2", undefined); // true: no claim
  ```

The file is never edited by hand. Take it again when Initiative's plug-in API
grows, from a checkout, a release or a running deployment; this rewrites the
file at the package's version and then the client from it:

```sh
npm run generate:plugin-api -- --checkout ../initiative   # runs its export with uv
npm run generate:plugin-api -- --release v0.75.0
npm run generate:plugin-api -- --url https://initiative.example.com
```

With no source, `npm run generate:plugin-api` regenerates the client from the
file and restamps its `info.version` with the package's; the Promote workflow
does this when it bumps the version. `npm run check:generated` fails when
either the file's version or the client is stale.

## Scopes

| Scope | Grants |
|---|---|
| `projects:read`, `projects:write` | Projects and what belongs to them: tasks, statuses, checklists. |
| `files:read`, `files:write` | Files: text documents, whiteboards, spreadsheets, links and uploads. |
| `queues:read`, `queues:write` | Queues, their items and commands. |
| `counter_groups:read`, `counter_groups:write` | Counter groups, their counters and commands. |
| `calendars:read`, `calendars:write` | Calendars, events and attendees. |
| `dashboards:read`, `dashboards:write` | Dashboards. |
| `posts:read`, `posts:write` | Posts, including pinning. |
| `galleries:read`, `galleries:write` | Galleries. |
| `wikis:read`, `wikis:write` | Wikis and their pages. |
| `comments:read`, `comments:write` | Comments on what the plug-in can read. |
| `relationships:read`, `relationships:write` | Links between items the plug-in can reach. |
| `tags:read`, `tags:write` | Reading, creating and applying tags. |
| `properties:read`, `properties:write` | Reading an initiative's custom property definitions and their options, and creating, changing and removing them. Setting a value on an item takes that item's own scope instead: a task's with `projects:write`. |
| `sharing:read`, `sharing:write` | Seeing who has access to something, and changing it where the plug-in's own access allows it. |
| `members:read` | The roster, as references, display names and avatars. |
| `initiatives:read` | The initiatives the plug-in is placed in. |
| `initiatives:moderate` | Acting as a moderator in an initiative it is placed in: everything there, within the plug-in's other scopes. Only on a token that asks for it (`level=moderator`) and is narrowed to that initiative. |
| `community:admin` | Acting with a community admin's standing across the community, within the plug-in's other scopes. Only on a token that asks for it (`level=community_admin`) and is not narrowed to an initiative. |
| `plugins:<public id>` | Calling that plug-in's public endpoints through Initiative, and reading the values it shows on items the plug-in can read. One per plug-in. |

A container plug-in's `scopes` go in its manifest's `service` block. A
declarative plug-in asks for read scopes alone, at the manifest's top level: it
keeps its own values on items those scopes read, and does not call Initiative.
A container plug-in with `callsPlugins: true` needs no `plugins:` scope in its
manifest: a community that installs another plug-in is asked there whether
this one may use it, and that grants `plugins:<public id>` for it.

Writing implies reading. Within its scopes a plug-in still sees only what is open
to the initiative, shared with the plug-in, or created by it — unless a token asks
for one of the two standings above. Those are never on a token by default: ask
for one with `asInstallation(installation, { initiative, level: "moderator" })`
or `asInstallation(installation, { level: "community_admin" })`, and Initiative
refuses it unless the community granted the matching scope. A member token
takes no `level`.
