/**
 * Verifying the tokens Initiative signs when it reaches the plug-in.
 *
 * Both kinds are EdDSA JWTs (RFC 8037) signed with the deployment's Ed25519
 * key and published in its JWKS at `/api/v1/plugin-platform/jwks.json`:
 *
 * - **Context token**, on every call to the plug-in (`Authorization: Bearer …`).
 *   Scope `endpoint` is a call to one endpoint, named by `endpoint_id`; scope
 *   `lifecycle` is a call to one hook, named by `hook`. When another plug-in made
 *   the call through Initiative it also carries `act` (that plug-in), `actor`,
 *   `member` and, when the caller was confined to one, `initiative_id`. When
 *   one of the plug-in's actions made the call, it carries `viewer` (the reader
 *   who ran it) and `subject` (the item it was run on).
 * - **Handoff token**, when a member opens one of the plug-in's pages. It names
 *   the member (`sub`), the page, and the initiative it was opened in. It is
 *   for one use.
 *
 * Each is checked the same way: `alg` = `EdDSA`, the `kid` against the
 * deployment's JWKS (only its OKP/Ed25519 keys are read), the signature,
 * `iss` = `initiative`, `aud` = `initiative-plugin:<public id>`, and `exp`/`iat`
 * against the clock with a small leeway. Any other algorithm is refused.
