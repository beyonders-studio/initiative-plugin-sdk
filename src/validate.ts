/**
 * Checking a manifest before a deployment does.
 *
 * **Schema-valid is necessary, not sufficient.** Some rules are not expressible
 * in JSON Schema and are checked by the platform on publish: cross-references
 * (the endpoint a widget binds, a `requires` term's connection, an endpoint's
 * service prefix), the features/blocks cross-check in both directions, UTF-8
 * byte-size caps, the rules tying a connection's `flow` and `token` to its
 * scope and fields, what a vendor `setup` writes to, the bounds, ids and
 * endpoints of `schedules`, which terms each kind's schedules, actions, fields
 * and webhook events take, the unique keys and ids of `fields`, `parts`,
 * `actions` and `settings`, the unique values of a field's `options`, what a
 * part's nodes, a field's element actions and an action's endpoint and
 * `params` name, the placeholders in a part's text, and a part's size and
 * depth.
 *
 * {@link validateManifest} runs the schema and then every one of those except
 * the byte caps. It also reports every term the contract does not declare: a
 * deployment drops such a term rather than refusing the manifest, so a
 * misspelt or retired field would otherwise do nothing without saying so. And
 * it adds one rule the platform does not check: an endpoint's `identity` must
 * name returns that endpoint actually sends.
 *
 * For a declarative plug-in it also parses every JSONata expression, and checks
 * that a plug-in is one kind or the other, what its requests and steps name, and
 * the hosts it calls.
