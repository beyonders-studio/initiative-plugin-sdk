/**
 * One typed definition of a plug-in.
 *
 * {@link definePlugin} takes everything a plug-in declares and does: its endpoints
 * with their handlers, its hooks and schedules, its widgets and pages, and
 * its listing. The same object routes Initiative's calls (`createPlugin`) and
 * becomes the manifest (`initiative-plugin build`), so nothing is stated twice.
 *
 * {@link defineEndpoint} types one endpoint from its own declaration: its
 * `params` type the handler's arguments and its `returns` type what the
 * handler answers with.
 *
 * A declarative plug-in gives each endpoint a `request` (or `steps`) and a `map`
 * in place of a handler, and names its `hosts`: Initiative then makes the
 * calls and maps the answers itself, and there is no service to run. Its
 * schedules, actions and webhook events say in a `write` how Initiative changes
 * the values it keeps on items. One plug-in is one kind or the other.
 *
 * Endpoints are named by their key. The manifest id is `plugin.<publicId>.<key>`,
 * and everywhere a definition refers to an endpoint (a widget, a sample, a
 * parameter's `options_from`, a bundled dashboard, `communitySummary`, an
 * action, a schedule) it uses the key.
